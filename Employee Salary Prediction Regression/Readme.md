#####Employee Salary Prediction
Project Overview

The Employee Salary Prediction project is a machine learning regression project aimed at predicting the salaries of employees based on features such as experience, education, job role, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide insights into salary trends and help organizations or individuals estimate compensation effectively.

Features

Data Analysis: Understanding the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations of key features and their relationship with salary.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare data for modeling.

Model Building: Implementation of regression algorithms to predict employee salaries. Common models used include:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

Gradient Boosting Regression

Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RÂ² Score

Dataset

The dataset contains employee information such as:

Experience: Number of years of professional experience

Education: Highest qualification attained

Job Role: Position of the employee

Department: Department in which the employee works

Salary: Target variable to predict

(Dataset can be sourced from Kaggle or any HR-related salary dataset.)

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-salary-prediction.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd employee-salary-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Load the dataset in the data/ folder.

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

python salary_prediction.py


Explore data, train models, and predict salaries using trained models.

Results

The trained regression models provide accurate salary predictions based on employee features.

Visualizations like feature importance and prediction vs actual plots help in interpreting results.

Future Enhancements

Incorporate additional features such as company size, location, or industry trends.

Deploy the model as a web application for interactive salary predictions.

Use deep learning models to capture non-linear relationships more effectively.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
